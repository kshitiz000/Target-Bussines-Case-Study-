# Target-Bussines-Case-Study-
As a renowned global brand and leading retailer in the United States, Target is recognized for its commitment to delivering exceptional value, inspiration, and innovation, creating an unparalleled guest experience. This business case focuses on Target's operations in Brazil, presenting insights derived from the analysis of a dataset encompassing 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The dataset provides a comprehensive perspective on order status, pricing, payment and freight performance, customer locations, product attributes, and reviews.

In this role, I successfully navigated and analyzed the extensive dataset, extracting valuable insights into Target's operations in Brazil. My analysis encompassed key dimensions, including order processing, pricing strategies, payment and shipping efficiency, customer demographics, product attributes, and overall customer satisfaction. This experience not only honed my analytical skills but also allowed me to contribute meaningful insights to enhance operational efficiency and strategic decision-making within the organization.
